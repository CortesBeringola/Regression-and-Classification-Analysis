# Regression-and-Classification-Analysis
• Gathered labor data about employees from different data sources and next imported the data into R to compare, preprocess and handle missing values, and produce an elaborate report summarizing all 30+ attributes 
• Built predictive models in R including diverse K-NN, discriminant analysis, and Naïve Bayes algorithms to properly classify the dataset and determine which attributes have more significance for model performance 
• Utilized Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks to predict the earnings of employees based on different socioeconomic factors
